Have you ever wanted to expose a local server to the entire internet?
It may sound scary but can be really useful. Use-cases are infinite, here are a few:
- You are developing a web application on your computer and you need to see instantly your modifications on a specific device or browser (smartphone, tablet, internet explorer...) without deploying it again and again.
- You are developing an application which works with webhooks, for example [GitHub webhooks](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/hooks/).
- You need to download some files from a coworker computer and you're far from him, or simply don't want to bother with a USB key.
- You are out of the office and need to access an IP filtered server.

Multiple solutions exist, open-source or not but my favorite is [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and you can learn to use it in just 2 minutes reading my latest contribution on [Theodo's blog](https://blog.theodo.fr/2016/06/expose-your-local-environment-to-the-world-with-ngrok/).
